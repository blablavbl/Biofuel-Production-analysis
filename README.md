# Biofuel-Production-analysis

This is a simple analysis of a biofuel production dataset found using google datasets.
The data covers the production of biofuel from various countries across the whole globe during the 2000-2010 decade, the data also includes the production per continent.

In this simple, and my first, analysis work the main focus is posed on transforming the given dataset in a format which is easy to plot using the seaborn library to visualize it and see how the different countries compare with eachother and also how the different continents do.

**WHAT IS BIOFUEL?**

Biofuel, any fuel that is derived from biomassâ€”that is, plant or algae material or animal waste. 
Since such feedstock material can be replenished readily, biofuel is considered to be a source of renewable energy, unlike fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Biofuel is commonly advocated as a cost-effective and environmentally benign alternative to petroleum and other fossil fuels, particularly within the context of rising petroleum prices and increased concern over the contributions made by fossil fuels to global warming.
